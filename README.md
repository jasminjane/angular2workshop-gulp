## Assignment 2
  * Create a web component (in app/components) that uses the PeopleService to get its Clients. (Similar: A1.x Page/Controller)
  * Create a web component (in app/shared_components) that holds 1 client and visualizes its properties. (Similar: A1.x Directive restrict 'E')
  * Use Angular 2 directives inside the page component to loop through Clients and insert each Client into a ClientProfile component.
  * Let ClientProfile log its Client on init.
  * Realize CRUD functionality for the Clients list held by the page component, delete and update must be called by the ClientProfile itself.
  * For editing and creating Clients, use local variables inside the template.
